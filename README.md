## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PHP (version 8.2.0 or more)
- MySQL database
- Web server (Apache)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keshav-exe/project-vaayu.git
   ```

2. Configure the database settings:

   - Open `database.php` and update the database connection parameters:

     ```php
     define('DB_HOST', 'your_database_host');
     define('DB_USER', 'your_database_user');
     define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_database_password');
     define('DB_NAME', 'your_database_name');
     ```

3. Import the database schema:

   - Execute the SQL script provided in `database.sql` to create the necessary tables. The database requires two tables:
     - `users`: Contains user details, including username and password.
     - `posts`: Stores journal entries, including the date, content, and any additional metadata.

4. Start your web server.

5. Open the web app in your browser:

   ```bash
   http://localhost/project-vaayu
   ```

## Usage

2. Navigate to the "Create Post" section to start writing your journal entry.
3. Use the search bar to find specific entries.
4. Log out when finished.
